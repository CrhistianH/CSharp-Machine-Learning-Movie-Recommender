# CSharp-Machine-Learning-Movie-Recommender

This is a console application developed in C# programming language along with the ML.NET namespace.

This application is used to recommend movies to a specific user based on his previous ratings on another movies by using the Matrix Factorization training algorythm. It can also predict the rating that a specific user will give to a selected movie and tell if that movie is recommended for the user or not, based on the same predicted rating.

The development of this application was achieved by following the Microsoft official tutorial: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/movie-recommendation. Some small features were added and some other modifications were done too so it could fit to my personal needs.

All CSV data files used on this program were already online and they were just added to the project.

A new user (611) was added to the "recommendation-ratings-train.csv" file. This is a real person, a friend of mine, who has rated most of the movies that she has seen before in order to test the software and rate the predictions that it makes. All ratings done by users <=610 were not added by me.
